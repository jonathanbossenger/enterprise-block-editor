## 3.2 Key Components and Their Applications

In this lesson, we'll explore essential components from the @wordpress/components package, which are crucial for creating rich, interactive user interfaces in the WordPress Block Editor. These components provide standardized UI elements that maintain consistency across the WordPress ecosystem while offering powerful functionality for block development.

## Button Component

The Button component is a fundamental building block for creating interactive elements in your custom blocks. It allows users to trigger actions or navigate through your interface.

```javascript
import { Button } from '@wordpress/components';

function MyCustomBlock() {
    return (
         console.log('Button clicked!')}
        >
            Click Me
        
    );
}
```

The Button component accepts various props to customize its appearance and behavior, such as 'variant' for styling and 'onClick' for handling user interactions.
