## 3.3 Best Practices for Using Components

When working with components from the @wordpress/components package, it's essential to understand how to customize them effectively and manage their state and interactivity. This lesson will explore best practices for using these components in your custom block development process.

### Customizing and Styling Components

The @wordpress/components package provides a wide range of pre-built components that adhere to WordPress design principles. However, you may often need to customize these components to fit your specific block requirements or match your theme's design.

#### Using Component Props

Most components in the @wordpress/components package come with a variety of props that allow you to customize their appearance and behavior. Always refer to the component's documentation to understand available props.

For example, the Button component offers several props for customization:

```javascript
import { Button } from '@wordpress/components';

function MyCustomButton() {
    return (
         console.log('Button clicked!')}
        >
            Click Me
        
    );
}
```

In this example, we've customized the Button's variant, size, and added an icon. These props allow for significant customization without writing additional CSS.

#### Applying Custom CSS

While component props offer a good starting point, you may need to apply custom CSS for more specific styling needs. You can do this by adding classes to your components and defining styles in your block's stylesheet.

```javascript
import { Button } from '@wordpress/components';

function MyCustomButton() {
    return (
         console.log('Button clicked!')}
        >
            Click Me
        
    );
}
```

Then in your block's style.scss file:

```scss
.my-custom-button {
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
    border-radius: 10px;
    padding: 10px 20px;
    
    &:hover {
        background-color: #e0e0e0;
    }
}
```

#### Overriding Default Styles

In some cases, you may need to override the default styles of a component. While this should be done cautiously to maintain consistency across the WordPress admin interface, it's sometimes necessary for unique design requirements.

You can use more specific CSS selectors to override default styles:

```scss
.wp-block-my-custom-block .components-button.is-primary {
    background-color: #ff6b6b;
    color: #ffffff;
    
    &:hover {
        background-color: #ff8787;
    }
}
```

This CSS targets a primary Button component specifically within your custom block, overriding its default blue color with a custom red shade.

### Handling Component State and Interactivity

Managing state and implementing interactivity are crucial aspects of creating dynamic and responsive blocks. The @wordpress/components package provides several tools to help with this.

#### Using the useState Hook

For simple state management within a component, the useState hook from React (available via @wordpress/element) is often sufficient:

```javascript
import { useState } from '@wordpress/element';
import { Button, TextControl } from '@wordpress/components';

function MyInteractiveComponent() {
    const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');

    return (
        
             setInputValue(newValue)}
            />
             console.log(`Submitted: ${inputValue}`)}
            >
                Submit
            
        
    );
}
```

In this example, we're using the TextControl component to capture user input and storing it in state using the useState hook.

#### Implementing Controlled Components

Many components in the @wordpress/components package are designed to be controlled components, meaning their state is controlled by React. This is typically done by passing a value prop and an onChange prop:

```javascript
import { useState } from '@wordpress/element';
import { ToggleControl } from '@wordpress/components';

function MyToggleComponent() {
    const [isToggled, setIsToggled] = useState(false);

    return (
         setIsToggled(!isToggled)}
        />
    );
}
```

Here, the ToggleControl's state is managed by our component, allowing us to respond to changes and update other parts of our UI accordingly.

#### Using the withState Higher-Order Component

For more complex state management, especially when dealing with multiple interrelated states, the withState higher-order component can be useful:

```javascript
import { withState } from '@wordpress/compose';
import { Button, TextControl } from '@wordpress/components';

function MyComplexComponent({ setState, name, email }) {
    return (
        
             setState({ name: newName })}
            />
             setState({ email: newEmail })}
            />
             console.log(`Submitted: ${name}, ${email}`)}
            >
                Submit
            
        
    );
}

export default withState({
    name: '',
    email: '',
})(MyComplexComponent);
```

The withState HOC provides a setState function and adds the state values as props to our component, simplifying the management of multiple state values.

#### Handling Side Effects with useEffect

When you need to perform side effects in response to state or prop changes, the useEffect hook is invaluable:

```javascript
import { useState, useEffect } from '@wordpress/element';
import { TextControl, Notice } from '@wordpress/components';

function MyEffectfulComponent() {
    const [username, setUsername] = useState('');
    const [isAvailable, setIsAvailable] = useState(null);

    useEffect(() => {
        if (username.length > 2) {
            // Simulating an API call to check username availability
            setTimeout(() => {
                setIsAvailable(Math.random() > 0.5);
            }, 500);
        } else {
            setIsAvailable(null);
        }
    }, [username]);

    return (
        
            
            {isAvailable === true && (
                
                    Username is available!
                
            )}
            {isAvailable === false && (
                
                    Username is not available.
                
            )}
        
    );
}
```

In this example, we use useEffect to simulate checking username availability whenever the username changes, updating our UI accordingly.

By mastering these techniques for customizing components and managing their state and interactivity, you'll be well-equipped to create sophisticated and responsive custom blocks using the @wordpress/components package. Remember to always consider performance implications, especially when dealing with complex state management or frequent updates.
