# Multisite Considerations for Block Development

When developing blocks for environments that utilize Multisite networks, developers face unique challenges and considerations. Understanding these nuances is important for creating blocks that function correctly, maintain appropriate permission structures, and deliver consistent user experiences across an entire network of sites.

## Understanding WordPress Multisite Architecture

Before diving into block development considerations, it's important to grasp how WordPress Multisite fundamentally works. Multisite allows you to create a network of websites under a single WordPress installation, sharing the same core files and database while maintaining separate content.

In a Multisite environment, you have a network-wide Super Admin role that oversees the entire installation, while individual sites can have their own administrators with more limited permissions. This hierarchical structure impacts how blocks are deployed, managed, and secured across your network.

When developing blocks for Multisite, you must consider that:

1. All sites share the same codebase, including plugin and theme files
2. Each site has its own database tables for content but shares user tables
3. Plugin and theme activation can occur network-wide or on individual sites
4. Permissions and capabilities can vary significantly between sites

These architectural characteristics directly impact how your blocks will behave across different sites in your network.

## Global vs. Site-Specific Blocks

### Understanding Block Registration in Multisite

In WordPress, blocks are typically registered using the `register_block_type()` function. In a Multisite environment, this registration occurs within the shared codebase, making the block technically available to all sites. However, this doesn't mean all sites should necessarily have access to every block.

The distinction between global and site-specific blocks often comes down to how you control access and visibility rather than separate codebases. Since all sites in the network share the same plugin files, you need to implement conditional logic to determine when and where blocks appear.

### Blocks are Global

By default, any blocks you register will be available globally across your entire network of sites. This is useful for registering fundamental content blocks, branded components, or enterprise-wide design elements that maintain consistency.

Global blocks should be designed with flexibility to accommodate different site contexts while maintaining brand consistency. You might include attributes that allow for limited customization while preserving critical brand elements.

### Implementing Site-Specific Blocks

For blocks that should only appear on certain sites within your network, you'll need to implement conditional registration or visibility. There are several approaches to achieve this:

1. **Conditional Registration Based on Site ID:**
```php
add_action( 'init', 'enterprise_register_site_specific_blocks' );
/**
 * Register blocks only for specific sites in the network.
 */
function enterprise_register_site_specific_blocks() {
    // Get the current site ID.
    $site_id = get_current_blog_id();
    
    // Array of site IDs that should have access to this specialized block.
    $allowed_sites = [ 2, 5, 9 ];
    
    if ( in_array( $site_id, $allowed_sites, true ) ) {
        register_block_type(
            plugin_dir_path( __FILE__ ) . 'build/specialized-department-block'
        );
    }
}
```

2. **Using Network Options for Configuration:**
You can create a network admin interface that allows the Super Admin to configure which blocks are available on which sites. This approach offers more flexibility than hardcoding site IDs.
```php
add_action( 'init', 'enterprise_register_configurable_blocks' );
/**
 * Register blocks based on network settings.
 */
function enterprise_register_configurable_blocks() {
    $site_id = get_current_blog_id();
    
    // Get network option that stores block configurations.
    $network_block_config = get_site_option( 'enterprise_block_availability', [] );
    
    if ( isset( $network_block_config[ $site_id ] ) && in_array( 'specialized-block', $network_block_config[ $site_id ], true ) ) {
        register_block_type(
            plugin_dir_path( __FILE__ ) . 'build/specialized-block'
        );
    }
}
```

## Customizing Block Permissions Based on User Roles Across Sites

In an enterprise Multisite environment, managing who can use which blocks becomes critical for maintaining governance and content standards. WordPress Multisite offers several ways to implement role-based block permissions.

### Understanding User Roles in Multisite

Multisite extends WordPress's role system with the addition of the Super Admin role. A typical permission hierarchy in Multisite might look like:

1. Super Admin - Controls the entire network
2. Site Administrator - Manages an individual site
3. Editor, Author, Contributor, etc. - Standard WordPress roles with varying permissions

When implementing block permissions, you need to consider this extended hierarchy and how it impacts block usage across your network.

For example, you might want to allow only Super Admins to use certain blocks that could affect the entire network, while Editors on individual sites can use a different set of blocks.

```php
add_action( 'init', 'super_admin_register_blocks' );
function super_admin_register_blocks() {
    // Only allow Super Admins to register this block.
    if ( ! is_super_admin() ) {
        return;
    }
	register_block_type( __DIR__ . '/build/super-admin-custom-block' );
}

add_action( 'init', 'editor_register_blocks' );
function editor_register_blocks() {
    // Allow Editors to register this block.
    if ( ! current_user_can( 'edit_posts' ) ) {
        return;
    }
    register_block_type( __DIR__ . '/build/editor-custom-block' );
}
```

### Programmatic Control to Block Editor Settings

You can also programmatically control the available blocks and other editor settings, via the [block_editor_settings_all](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/block_editor_settings_all/) filter. 

This allows you to customize the block editor experience based on user roles and site IDs.:

```php
add_filter( 'block_editor_settings_all', 'enterprise_filter_allowed_blocks', 10, 2 );
/**
 * Customize available blocks based on user role and site.
 *
 * @param array $settings The editor settings.
 * @param array $context The post editor context.
 * @return array Filtered settings.
 */
function enterprise_filter_allowed_blocks( $settings, $context ) {
    // Get current user and site info.
    $user = wp_get_current_user();
    $site_id = get_current_blog_id();
    
    // If user is a super admin, don't restrict blocks.
    if ( is_super_admin() ) {
        return $settings;
    }
    
    // Define restricted blocks for certain roles.
    $restricted_blocks = [
        'core/html', // Restrict HTML block
        'core/shortcode', // Restrict shortcode block
    ];
    
    // If user is only an author, add more restrictions.
    if ( in_array( 'author', $user->roles, true ) ) {
        $restricted_blocks = array_merge( $restricted_blocks, [
            'core/cover',
            'core/media-text',
        ] );
    }
    
    // Different sites might have different restrictions.
    if ( $site_id === 2 && in_array( 'editor', $user->roles, true ) ) {
        // Special restrictions for editors on site ID 2.
        $restricted_blocks[] = 'core/columns';
    }
    
    // Filter the allowed blocks list.
    if ( isset( $settings['allowedBlockTypes'] ) && is_array( $settings['allowedBlockTypes'] ) ) {
        $settings['allowedBlockTypes'] = array_filter(
            $settings['allowedBlockTypes'],
            function( $block_name ) use ( $restricted_blocks ) {
                return ! in_array( $block_name, $restricted_blocks, true );
            }
        );
    }
    
    return $settings;
}
```

This approach gives you fine-grained control over which blocks are available to which users on which sites.

### Using Block Patterns for Multisite Governance

Block patterns can be an effective way to standardize content structures across multiple sites while still allowing for appropriate levels of customization:

Block patterns provide a balance between standardization and flexibility, guiding content creators to use approved layouts while still allowing them to customize the content within those layouts.

```php
add_action( 'init', 'enterprise_register_block_patterns' );

/**
 * Register enterprise block patterns for Multisite.
 */
function enterprise_register_block_patterns() {
    // Only register if the function exists (WordPress 5.5+).
    if ( function_exists( 'register_block_pattern_category' ) ) {
        register_block_pattern_category(
            'enterprise-layouts',
            [ 'label' => __( 'Enterprise Layouts', 'enterprise-blocks' ) ]
        );
        
        // Register a standard enterprise layout pattern.
        register_block_pattern(
            'enterprise-blocks/department-page',
            [
                'title'       => __( 'Department Page Layout', 'enterprise-blocks' ),
                'description' => __( 'Standard layout for department pages across all sites.', 'enterprise-blocks' ),
                'categories'  => [ 'enterprise-layouts' ],
                'content'     => '<!-- wp:group {"className":"department-header"} -->
                                <div class="wp-block-group department-header">
                                    <!-- wp:heading {"level":1} -->
                                    <h1>Department Name</h1>
                                    <!-- /wp:heading -->
                                    
                                    <!-- wp:paragraph {"className":"department-mission"} -->
                                    <p class="department-mission">Department mission statement goes here.</p>

                                <!-- wp:columns -->
                                <div class="wp-block-columns">
                                    <!-- wp:column {"width":"66.66%"} -->
